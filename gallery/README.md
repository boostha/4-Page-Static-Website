## Code Review

I had a hard time figuring out how to make the grid responsive because as I shrunk the page, the first column would stay the same size and the rest would shrink. I figured out that repeat auto-fit minmax 200px 350px was the problem and I switched the auto-fit to the number of columns I wanted and the entire gallery started responding the way I wanted it to. Benefits from this problem was that I feel much more comfortable with grid, I wish that grid column and row did not restrict it to be so static though.
