## Code Review
I tried to put a text shadow on the gradient text to make it more readable in the phone view because it sits right behind the controller and was kinda hard to read. But the text shadow mixed with the gradient code makes the entire text a weird black color so instead I used the filter drop shadow and it worked. Benefits other than making it more readable, is that I now know another way of putting a shadow behind a text for the future.
