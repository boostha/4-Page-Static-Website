## Code Review
One bug that I ran into was that when the screen got small enough to have only one column of content. All my pictures, text and buttons were sticking to the left side, I could not fix it with justify content or align items. The solution was that I had to use text align instead, which confused me because I did not know it would affect img and a tags. One benefit was I learned that text align does not only align text but can align other properties as well.
